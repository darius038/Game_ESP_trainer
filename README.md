The ESP trainer was developed under a NASA program by Russell Targ at Stanford Research Institute.
The player is presented with four colored squares. For each trial, one has been selected at random 
by the ESP Trainer. Your task is to choose the correct square.

If you succeed, you will hear a chime, feel a vibration, and see a large color picture. 
Otherwise, the system lights up the correct square, and you proceed with the next trial. 
The score indicator at the top counts the number of correct choices. Words of encouragement 
appear as you achieve the scoring levels of 6, 8. 10, 12 or 14 hits. After 24 trials you may begin a new game.
